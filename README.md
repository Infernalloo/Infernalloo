# Inferno / Infernal / Infernalloo
Hi everyone, I'm Inferno, a teen who recently started liking coding and related stuff. Minding my own business here.<br>
I really like to personalize stuff, especially with the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/). <br>
Hope I can learn as much as possible.<br>

Yearly objectives:<br>
2023: learn Python<br>
2024 Q1: learn Nim<br>
